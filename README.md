# Phase 4 Code Challenge (CodeGrade)

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive data science code challenge designed to assess applied understanding in:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) & Pipelines**
- **Ensemble Methods & Boosting Techniques**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Clustering with KMeans**

It draws from key concepts covered across lectures, labs, and practice challenges in Phase 4, and showcases practical implementation using real-world datasets.

## Tools & Resources

- p4_code_challenge.ipynb (Main notebook)
- mall_clust.csv (Dataset for customer segmentation)
- sentiment_analysis.csv (Dataset for NLP sentiment classification)
- wheat_seeds.csv (Dataset for seed classification)

---

##  Project Structure

### 1. KNN & Pipelines
- Preprocess the wheat seed dataset
- Fit a KNN classifier
- Evaluate with metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Wrap preprocessing and model into a pipeline

### 2. Ensemble & Boosting
- Use ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Compare model performance
- Use feature importance for interpretation

### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Clean and preprocess text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- Use TF-IDF vectorization
- Train a Naive Bayes model for sentiment classification

### 4. Clustering
- Scale mall customer data
- Apply KMeans clustering
- Use silhouette scores to determine optimal number of clusters
- Visualize results with cluster assignments
